In the article “Four Decades of Island Area Change Across Tuvalu” by CO2 Science, the author argues that Tuvalu residents are not in danger of becoming climate refugees (CO2 Science, 2020). The article acknowledges that this region of the Earth has been experiencing rising sea levels twice the rate compared to the rest of the world. The authors state up until now, many thought Tuvalu’s citizens would most likely become the world’s first climate refugees, as the rising waters will cause flooding. The argument is introduced by discussing a peer-reviewed article out of New Zealand. The New Zealand researchers used historical aerial photographs and satellite images with over 43 years of data to find most islands in the study area had experienced a net increase of area. Tuvalu has specifically had a net gain of 73.5 ha of land over that time period, equal to 2.9% of its land. The article concludes by saying that these observations show that the island is not threatened by climate change due to the increase of land and that “… climate alarmists have ridiculously portrayed Tuvalu”.
